This repository should not be used as the base for a romhack! That's a dumb idea.

## Using the Repo as a reference

Some things are a good reference, other things are not. Most of my code is not, because I'm bad at writing code (that's why I don't share it!) but you can try anyway. That being said, I do not suggest using this repository to clone audio decomp, the setup is very strange.

## Installation

The build process is almost identical to regular decomp, but with a slight difference: a decompressed ROM for "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" version 1.0 US now must be placed in the main folder with the name "10u.z64". This is because the make process has been modified to extract and build a variety of assets from the retail release of the game, while still extracting more inconsequential files from Master Quest Debug.
