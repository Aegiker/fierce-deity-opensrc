# The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Chaos Edition

```diff
- WARNING! -

This mod has not had extensive testing and some features may not work as intended.
That being said, that kinda fits the theme anyway... as long as it isn't a crash.

## Installation

The build process is almost identical to regular decomp, but with a slight difference: a decompressed ROM for "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" version 1.0 US now must be placed in the main folder with the name "10u.z64". This is because the make process has been modified to extract and build a variety of assets from the retail release of the game, while still extracting more inconsequential files from Master Quest Debug.
